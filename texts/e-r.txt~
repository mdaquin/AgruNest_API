[...] That our whole affection be placed upon God, and that we love him so entirely as to love none but him. I come now to justify this sense, which I shall endeavour to establish upon this double basis in general.<br/>
  I. THAT God is the only author or cause of our love. <br/>
  II.THAT he is also the only proper object of it
</p>

<p>
[…] Well then, we have now at length found out the true cause of all our pleasure, and in that the only proper object of our love. And certainly, if ever philosophy were a handmaid to divinity, it is now, as furnishing us with a certain ground for the most sublime and noble conclusion in the world, the full, perfect and entire love of God, which now appears to be founded upon principles, and to be demonstrable in a clear and distinct order of reasoning. For if God be the only true cause that acts upon our spirits, and produces our pleasure, then he only does us good, he only perfects our being and makes us happy; and if he only does us good, then he only is our good; and if he only is our good, then he only is lovely, or the proper object of our love; and if he only is lovely, then ’tis plain that we ought to love none but him, and him entirely.  Or to argue backwards, we are to love nothing but what is lovely; nothing is lovely but what is our Good; nothing is our Good, but what does us good; nothing does us good but what causes Pleasure in us; nothing causes Pleasure in us but God; therefore we are to love nothing but God. I say nothing but God, for he is the only lovely Object, and he is infinitely so. Nothing but God, for he only is our Good. Nothing but God, for he only does us good and makes us happy. Nothing but God, for he only is the author of all our pleasure; and in him we not only live, move and have our being, but have also all the joy and comfort of our being. Whatever degree of good we have received, we have received it of him; whatever we enjoy, we enjoy it in him; and whatever we expect, we expect it from him, with whom is the Well of Life, [Book of Psalms 36. 9.] And in whose light we hope to see light; and therefore we are to love none but him, and him with the whole heart, soul, and mind, with the full weight of our desire, with all the activity of our love.</p>

<p>
[…] If it should now be objected (as ’tis very probable it may) that the enlarging this first commandment to such a magnitude, will make it devour and swallow up the second. For if the love of God must be thus perfect and entire, so as to be exclusive of all creatures [i.e. human beings], what room can then be left for the love of our neighbour? To this the answer is very easy and very clear. If our love to God and our neighbour were of the same kind, the entire love of the former would indeed wholly exclude that of the latter. But this is not the case. […] That is in short, we love God with love of desire, and we love our neighbour with love of benevolence or charity. But now the entire desire of God is very consistent with all manner of benevolence to our neighbour. It does indeed wholly exclude all love of desire towards him. But this is what I contend for, I would have the love of God so vehement and so ardent, as to burn up, devour, yea, utterly annihilate all desire of the creature.</p>

<p>LETTER 1. To Mr. Norris.</p>

<p>SIR,</p>

<p>
[…]Reading the other day the third volume of your excellent Discourses, as I do everything you write with great pleasure and no less advantage; yet taking the liberty that I use with other books, (and yours or nobody’s will bear it) to raise all the objections that ever I can, and to make them undergo the severest test my thoughts can put them to before they pass for current, a difficulty arose which without your assistance I know not how to solve.</p>

<p>
Methinks there is all the reason in the world to conclude, That GOD is the only efficient cause of all our sensations; and you have made it as clear as the day; and it is equally clear from the letter of the commandment, That GOD is not only the principal, but the sole object of our love: But the reason you assign for it, namely, because he is the only efficient cause of our pleasure, seems not equally clear. For if we must love nothing but what is lovely, and nothing is lovely but what is our good, and nothing is our good but what does us good, and nothing does us good but what causes pleasure in us; may we not by the same way of arguing say, That that which causes pain in us does not do us good, (for nothing you say does us good but what causes pleasure) and therefore can’t be our good, and if not our good then not lovely, and consequently not the proper, much less the only object of our love? Again, if the author of our pleasure be upon that account the only object of our love, then by the same reason the author of our pain can’t be the object of our love; and if both these sensations be produced by the same cause, then that cause is at once the object of our love, and of our aversion; for it is as natural to avoid and fly from pain, as it is to follow and pursue pleasure?</p>

<p>
So that if these principles, viz. That GOD is the efficient cause of our sensations, (pain as well as pleasure) and that he is the only object of our love, be firm and true, as I believe they are; it will then follow, either that the being the cause of our pleasure is not the true and proper reason why that cause should be the object of our love, (for the author of our pain has as good a title to our love as the author of our pleasure;) Or else, if nothing be the object of our love but what does us good, then something else does us good besides what causes pleasure? Or to speak more properly, the cause of all our sensations, pain as well as pleasure being the only object of our love, and nothing being lovely but what does us good, consequently, that which causes pain does us good as well as that which causes pleasure; and therefore it can’t be true, That nothing does us good but what causes pleasure.</p>

<p>
[…]Honoured Sir, Your great admirer and most humble servant.</p>

<p>
Indeed, in a sermon upon this subject, [Bible: Matt. xxii. 37.] the author pretends to establish his sense of the words upon a double basis. 1. That God is the only cause of our love. 2. That he is also the only proper object of it. But in reference to the first, he does no more to this purpose, but prove what (plainly expressed) cannot be contested; viz. That we receive the power which we have of desiring, from God: And then asks himself several questions, [such] as, Can God act for a creature? Does not God make all things for himself? &c. Which amount only to thus much, that they signify it is his opinion, that God (who doubtless made all things for himself) because his own glory was his primary end in creating all things, had not therefore secondary, and intermediate ends for which he made the creatures to operate one upon another: Which is but in a tacit way to beg the question. But he confesses rightly, that the stress of this business lies in the proof of the second proposition. Upon this hinge (says he) the whole weight of the theory turns, viz. That God is the only proper object of our love, as being the only cause of all our pleasing sensations; the creatures having no efficiency at all to operate upon us; they being only occasional causes of those sentiments which God produces in us. And on this foundation it then is, that he asserts, that every act that carries our desires towards the creature is sinful: which opinion if received, and followed, must necessarily bring in the like unintelligible way of practical religion.</p>

<p>
[…] There is nothing more evident than that mankind is designed for a sociable life. To say that religion unfits us for it, is to reproach the wisdom of God as highly as it is possible; And to represent religion as the most mischievous thing in the world, dissolving societies. And there could not be a greater artifice of the Devil, or wicked men to bring Christianity into contempt than this. But it is to be hoped, that where the Scriptures are allowed to be read, this can never prevail; And that those who are not in danger of being led into it by the superstitions of priest-craft, will not be imposed upon in it by vain philosophy: Nor can there be any stronger evidence, that (that notion, of the love of God, grounded on his being the immediate cause of all our sensations) is false, than this, viz. That it destroys all the duties and obligations of social life. This indeed is not Mr. N[orris]’s deduction from thence, But it is that of his oracle Pere Malebranche, and that of reason; And he will scarce be believed to be sincere, that shall say he can daily see and enjoy the creatures as goods, without desiring them as such; Or that shall deny, that if it be our duty not to desire any creature, it must then necessarily be our duty (as P. M. expressly says it is) to have as little communication with them as is possible; and to betake ourselves to deserts.</p>

<p>
[…] But if in opposition to this, any one should run into the other extreme, of retreating wholly from all commerce and conversation with men; And should give themselves the happiness Pere Malebranche speaks of, of attending eternity in deserts; it is to be feared they would not mend the matter. For whatever vices they might part with by it, they must necessarily oppose thereby, one great end that they were sent into the world for, viz. of doing good; By becoming wholly useless to others: And such a one would certainly, by such a renunciation of all commerce with men, be likelier to grow wild, than improve the great virtue of Christianity, and ornament of human nature, good will, charity, and the being useful to others.</p>
