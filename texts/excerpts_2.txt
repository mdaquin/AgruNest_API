To Mr. Norris.
</p>

<p>
You'll wonder Sir, that I look back upon a finished Subject, but because you have in these letters answered most of the objections that are made against your printed discourse, and because I am very desirous your hypothesis should appear in its full light, though in my first I conceded one of the main things you contend for, viz. That GOD is the only efficient cause of all our sensation; yet since very many object against this proposition, and something has offered itself to my thoughts, perhaps not altogether impertinent, give me leave to examine the matter a little further. And methinks the main stress of the objections lies in these two points. First, That this theory renders a great part of GOD's workmanship vain and useless. Secondly, That it does not well comport with his Majesty.
</p>

<p>
For the first, That this theory renders a great part of GOD's workmanship vain and useless, it may be thus argued. Allowing that sensation is only in the soul, that there is nothing in body but magnitude, figure and motion, and that being without thought itself it is not able to produce it in us, and therefore those sensations, whether of pleasure or pain, which we feel at the presence of bodies, must be produced by some higher cause than they; yet if the objects of our senses have no natural efficiency towards the producing of those sensations which we feel at their presence, if they serve no further than as positive and arbitrary conditions to determine the action of the true and proper cause, if they have nothing in their own nature to qualify them to be instrumental to the production of such and such sensations, but that if GOD should so please (the nature of the things notwithstanding) we might as well feel cold at the presence of fire as of water, and heat at the application of water or any other creature, and since GOD may as well excite sensations in our souls without these positive conditions as with them, to what end do they serve? And then what becomes of that acknowledged truth that GOD does nothing in vain, when such variety of objects as our senses are exercised about are wholly unnecessary? Why therefore may there not be a sensible congruity between those powers of the soul that are employed in sensation, and those objects which occasion it? Analogous to that vital congruity which your friend Dr. More (Immor. of the Soul, B. 11. Chap. 14. S. 8.) will have to be between some certain modifications of matter, and the plastic part of the soul, which notion he illustrates by that pleasure which the preceptive part of the soul (as he calls it) is affected with by good music or delicious viands [foods], as I do this of sensible by his of vital congruity, and methinks they are so symbolical that if the one be admitted the other may. For as the soul forsakes her body when this vital congruity fails, so when this sensible congruity is wanting, as in the case of blindness, deafness, or the palsy, &c. the soul has no sensation of colours, sounds, heat and the like, so that although bodies make the same impression that they used to do on her body, yet whilst it is under this indisposition, she has not that sentiment of pleasure or pain which used to accompany that impression, and therefore though there be no such thing as sensation in bodies, yet why may there not be a congruity in them by their presence to draw forth such sensations in the soul? Especially since in the next place, it seems more agreeable to the Majesty of GOD, and that order he has established in the world, to say that he produces our sensations mediately by his Servant Nature, than to affirm that he does it immediately by his own Almighty Power.</p>

<p>
[…] For certainly that being only deserves our love, even our whole love, who has it always in his power to better and perfect our nature, and who does voluntarily and freely exert that power. Which former clause I add to cut off our love from all rational creatures, who may be instrumental to our good designedly and freely, but since their power is not originally from themselves, neither are they always in a capacity of exerting it, seeing they may, and very often do, want either power or will to help us, therefore they are not the proper objects of our love.</p>

<p>
[…] Your faithful friend and servant.

[…] The creatures [i.e. human beings] they say are occasional causes of our pleasing sensations. Then, however, they are causes of them. They deny not also, That they are such causes as are always accompanied with the effect, and without which the effect is not produced. And are they not then considered as goods to us, just the same as if they were efficient causes? Or must we think a beautiful flower has not the same appearance, whether it be believed that God has lodged a power in the flower to excite the idea of its colour in us, or that he himself exhibits the Idea of its colour at the presence of that object? If the flower is either way equally pleasing (as certainly it is) then it is also equally desirable. But the wisdom of God cannot herein be equally admired, because it is not equally conspicuous. For if God immediately exhibits to me all my ideas, and that I do not truly see with my eyes, and hear with my ears; then all that wonderful exactness and curious workmanship, in framing the organs of sense, seems superfluous and vain; which is no small reflection upon infinite wisdom.</p>

<p>[…] There is nothing more evident than that mankind is designed for a sociable life. To say that religion unfits us for it, is to reproach the wisdom of God as highly as it is possible; And to represent religion as the most mischievous thing in the world, dissolving societies. And there could not be a greater artifice of the Devil, or wicked men to bring Christianity into contempt than this. But it is to be hoped, that where the Scriptures are allowed to be read, this can never prevail; And that those who are not in danger of being led into it by the superstitions of priest-craft, will not be imposed upon in it by vain philosophy: Nor can there be any stronger evidence, that (that notion, of the love of God, grounded on his being the immediate cause of all our sensations) is false, than this, viz. That it destroys all the duties and obligations of social life. This indeed is not Mr. N[orris]'s deduction from thence, But it is that of his oracle Pere Malebranche, and that of reason; And he will scarce be believed to be sincere, that shall say he can daily see and enjoy the creatures as goods, without desiring them as such; Or that shall deny, that if it be our duty not to desire any creature, it must then necessarily be our duty (as P. M. expressly says it is) to have as little communication with them as is possible; and to betake ourselves to deserts. But whether it were that Mr. N[orris]. has no inclination to this way of living, and that it is to that that we owe his happy invention of seeking, and enjoying the good things of the world, without loving them; Or that he was afraid by owning his opinion (that we are obliged to renounce the world and live in woods) he should be suspected of favouring popish superstition; He can scarcely be presumed not to see that this inevitably follows from the hypothesis he has embraced. But yet how injurious soever this consequence is to religion, so much is not therefore denied to what Pere. Malebranche largely insists upon, viz. That retirement is sometimes useful, if not necessary to a Christian life. Those who live always in the hurry of the world, and the avocations of worldly business, without giving themselves time, and retreat, frequently to reflect, being no doubt very likely to enter too much into the Spirit of it; We insensibly giving up ourselves to, and uniting our hearts with what we are constantly engaged in, and with delight apply ourselves to.</p>

<p>But if in opposition to this, any one should run into the other extreme, of retreating wholly from all commerce and conversation with men; And should give themselves the happiness Pere Malebranche speaks of, of attending eternity in deserts; it is to be feared they would not mend the matter. For whatever vices they might part with by it, they must necessarily oppose thereby, one great end that they were sent into the world for, viz. of doing good; By becoming wholly useless to others: And such a one would certainly, by such a renunciation of all commerce with men, be likelier to grow wild, than improve the great virtue of Christianity, and ornament of human nature, good will, charity, and the being useful to others.</p>
