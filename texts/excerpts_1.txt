<p>
The sense of it I have already explained, and made to be the same with what the letter of the text imports; namely, That our whole affection be placed upon God, and that we love him so entirely as to love none but him. I come now to justify this sense, which I shall endeavour to establish upon this double basis in general.
THAT God is the only author or cause of our love.
THAT he is also the only proper object of it.
</p>

<p>
[…] Well then, we have now at length found out the true cause of all our pleasure, and in that the only proper object of our love. And certainly, if ever philosophy were a handmaid to divinity, it is now, as furnishing us with a certain ground for the most sublime and noble conclusion in the world, the full, perfect and entire love of God, which now appears to be founded upon principles, and to be demonstrable in a clear and distinct order of reasoning. For if God be the only true cause that acts upon our spirits, and produces our pleasure, then he only does us good, he only perfects our being and makes us happy; and if he only does us good, then he only is our good; and if he only is our good, then he only is lovely, or the proper object of our love; and if he only is lovely, then ’tis plain that we ought to love none but him, and him entirely.  Or to argue backwards, we are to love nothing but what is lovely; nothing is lovely but what is our Good; nothing is our Good, but what does us good; nothing does us good but what causes Pleasure in us; nothing causes Pleasure in us but God; therefore we are to love nothing but God. I say nothing but God, for he is the only lovely Object, and he is infinitely so. Nothing but God, for he only is our Good. Nothing but God, for he only does us good and makes us happy. Nothing but God, for he only is the author of all our pleasure; and in him we not only live, move and have our being, but have also all the joy and comfort of our being. Whatever degree of good we have received, we have received it of him; whatever we enjoy, we enjoy it in him; and whatever we expect, we expect it from him, with whom is the Well of Life, [Book of Psalms 36. 9.] And in whose light we hope to see light; and therefore we are to love none but him, and him with the whole heart, soul, and mind, with the full weight of our desire, with all the activity of our love.
</p>
<p>
[…] If it should now be objected (as ’tis very probable it may) that the enlarging this first commandment to such a magnitude, will make it devour and swallow up the second. For if the love of God must be thus perfect and entire, so as to be exclusive of all creatures [i.e. human beings], what room can then be left for the love of our neighbour? To this the answer is very easy and very clear. If our love to God and our neighbour were of the same kind, the entire love of the former would indeed wholly exclude that of the latter. But this is not the case. We are not here supposed to love God in the same sense, or with the same sort of love wherewith we love our neighbour. We do not love God by wishing any good to him (whereof he is not capable) but by wishing him as a good to ourselves. On the contrary, we do not, or at least should not love our neighbour by wishing him as a good to ourselves, (for he is not our good) but by wishing good to him. That is in short, we love God with love of desire, and we love our neighbour with love of benevolence or charity.  But now the entire desire of God is very consistent with all manner of benevolence to our neighbour. It does indeed wholly exclude all love of desire towards him. But this is what I contend for, I would have the love of God so vehement and so ardent, as to burn up, devour, yea, utterly annihilate all desire of the creature.
</p>
<p>
Must I not then you’ll say, at all love creatures? What may I not love this or that delicate fruit, or this or that rich wine? May not I love what delights my palate, and yields me pleasure? Yes, if bodies were the true causes of your pleasure, you might, nay you ought to love them, as being upon that supposition your proper good. But this is the very thing they are defective in; we have clear and incontestable reason to assure us, that they are not the true real causes of any of our sensations.

<p>LETTER 1. To Mr. Norris.</p>

<p>
SIR,
Though some morose gentlemen would perhaps remit me to the distaff or the kitchen, or at least to the glass and the needle, the proper employments as they fancy of a woman’s life; yet expecting better things from the more equitable and ingenious Mr. Norris, who is not so narrow-souled as to confine learning to his own sex, or to envy it in ours, I presume to beg his attention a little to the impertinencies of a woman’s pen. And indeed Sir, there is some reason why I, though a stranger, should address to you for the resolution of my doubts and information of my judgment, since you have increased my natural thirst for truth, and set me up for a virtuoso. For though I can't pretend to a multitude of books, variety of languages, the advantages of academical education, or any helps but what my own curiosity afford; yet, thinking is a stock that no rational creature can want, if they know but how to use it; and this, as you have taught me, with purity and prayer, (which I wish were as much practised as they are easy to practise) is the way and method to true knowledge. But setting preface and apology aside, the occasion of giving you this trouble is this:
</p>

<p>
Reading the other day the third volume of your excellent Discourses, as I do everything you write with great pleasure and no less advantage; yet taking the liberty that I use with other books, (and yours or nobody’s will bear it) to raise all the objections that ever I can, and to make them undergo the severest test my thoughts can put them to before they pass for current, a difficulty arose which without your assistance I know not how to solve.
</p>

<p>Methinks there is all the reason in the world to conclude, That GOD is the only efficient cause of all our sensations; and you have made it as clear as the day; and it is equally clear from the letter of the commandment, That GOD is not only the principal, but the sole object of our love: But the reason you assign for it, namely, because he is the only efficient cause of our pleasure, seems not equally clear. For if we must love nothing but what is lovely, and nothing is lovely but what is our good, and nothing is our good but what does us good, and nothing does us good but what causes pleasure in us; may we not by the same way of arguing say, That that which causes pain in us does not do us good, (for nothing you say does us good but what causes pleasure) and therefore can't be our good, and if not our good then not lovely, and consequently not the proper, much less the only object of our love? Again, if the author of our pleasure be upon that account the only object of our love, then by the same reason the author of our pain can't be the object of our love; and if both these sensations be produced by the same cause, then that cause is at once the object of our love, and of our aversion; for it is as natural to avoid and fly from pain, as it is to follow and pursue pleasure?
</p>

<p>
So that if these principles, viz. That GOD is the efficient cause of our sensations, (pain as well as pleasure) and that he is the only object of our love, be firm and true, as I believe they are; it will then follow, either that the being the cause of our pleasure is not the true and proper reason why that cause should be the object of our love, (for the author of our pain has as good a title to our love as the author of our pleasure;) Or else, if nothing be the object of our love but what does us good, then something else does us good besides what causes pleasure? Or to speak more properly, the cause of all our sensations, pain as well as pleasure being the only object of our love, and nothing being lovely but what does us good, consequently, that which causes pain does us good as well as that which causes pleasure; and therefore it can't be true, That nothing does us good but what causes pleasure.</p>

<p>
[…]Honoured Sir, Your great admirer and most humble servant.
London, St. Matthew's day, 1693.

</i>

<p>Indeed, in a sermon upon this subject, [Bible: Matt. xxii. 37.] the author pretends to establish his sense of the words upon a double basis. 1. That God is the only cause of our love. 2. That he is also the only proper object of it. But in reference to the first, he does no more to this purpose, but prove what (plainly expressed) cannot be contested; viz. That we receive the power which we have of desiring, from God: And then asks himself several questions, [such] as, Can God act for a creature? Does not God make all things for himself? &c. Which amount only to thus much, that they signify it is his opinion, that God (who doubtless made all things for himself) because his own glory was his primary end in creating all things, had not therefore secondary, and intermediate ends for which he made the creatures to operate one upon another: Which is but in a tacit way to beg the question. But he confesses rightly, that the stress of this business lies in the proof of the second proposition. Upon this hinge (says he) the whole weight of the theory turns, viz. That God is the only proper object of our love, as being the only cause of all our pleasing sensations; the creatures having no efficiency at all to operate upon us; they being only occasional causes of those sentiments which God produces in us. And on this foundation it then is, that he asserts, that every act that carries our desires towards the creature is sinful: which opinion if received, and followed, must necessarily bring in the like unintelligible way of practical religion.</p>
<p>
[…] How little it signifies to this matter (though the stress of the assertion lies in it) to say, That sensible objects are not the efficient, but occasional causes of our pleasing sensations, will soon be considered. But if when we use the word love, we reflected what it is we mean by it, we should perhaps be more enlightened than by Mr. N[orris]'s definition of it, and should learn to distinguish better, than to call different passions by the same name; or confound love, with whatever is a concomitant of it.
</p
<p>
When I say that I love my child, or my friend, I find that my meaning is, that they are things I am delighted in; their being is a pleasure to me.
</p>
<p>
When I say that I love God above all, I find I would express that he is my chiefest good, and I delight in him above all things.
</p>
<p>
Again, when I say that I love myself, I likewise mean by it that my being is dear, and pleasing to me. To say one loves a thing, and that it is that which one has complacency in, is just the same: love being only a name given to that disposition, or act of the mind, we find in ourselves towards anything we are pleas'd with; And so far as it is simply love, consists barely in that; and cannot be distinguished into different acts of wishing well, and desiring; which are other different acts of the mind, consequential to love, according to the difference of the object. To intelligent beings that we love, our love is followed with acts of benevolence, or wishing well to the being, and happiness of that thing that helps to make us happy; and with desire of enjoying that in them that delights us: And our love to inanimate things is followed with benevolence and well-wishing to their being, if it may be continued with their enjoyment; and with desire also of enjoying them. But, because benevolence appears most in wishing happiness to beings capable of it; And the use of most inanimate things which we love and desire to enjoy, destroys them in the enjoyment; Therefore learned men have talked as if there were two sorts of love. Whereas love is but one simple act of the mind, always accompanied with desire, and benevolence too, where the object is capable of it. But as that definition which Mr. N[orris]. has given us, (viz. That love is that original weight, bent or endeavour, whereby the soul stands inclined to, and is moved forwards to good in general, or happiness) tells as not so well what love is, as our own hearts can when we consult them; So perhaps an examination of them will not only better acquaint us with the nature of our passions; but also direct us better to the measures of their regulation, than notions concerning them deduced from the consequences of an hypothesis.</p>
<p>
But for whatever cause Mr. N[orris]. omitted these reasons of St. John for our not loving the world, and the things of it; And substituted one of his own in the place; viz. That the creatures are not the efficient, but occasional cause of our pleasing sensations; He does say, that, without the knowledge of this his hypothesis, we cannot know that every degree of love of the creature is sinful; and consequently that St. John's reasons for enforcing the duty he urges, were defective. But St. John tells us not that every degree of love of the creature is sinful: On the contrary, he says, If we love not our brother whom we have seen, how can we love God whom we have not seen?</p>
